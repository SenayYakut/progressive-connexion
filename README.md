# progressive-connexion
Progressive integration of connexion into a flask app

## Dependencies

There's a file called `main_requirements.txt` that was used to install the app initially.
The output of this has been frozen to `requirements.txt` via `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

If you do not mind the transitive dependencies being different install with:

```bash
pip install -r main_requirements.txt
```

Otherwise install with
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
